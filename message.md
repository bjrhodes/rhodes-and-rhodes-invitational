Hello Saturday Friends!

Next _Saturday_; We meet at _Mendip Activity Centre_ car park at _12 midday_. https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.3321351,-2.8153744,16.46z?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkyMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D

If you've not been before you'll want some decent footwear, some discs to throw and some weather-appropriate clothing. There is a cafe and toilets at the car park if you like that sort of thing, but probably bring some water as well.

There are THREE official signed layouts at the centre and we will be playing none of them; instead we will play the "Johnnie Walker" layout from uDisc which comprises all ten of the advanced holes, a couple of the intermediate holes and a couple of holes just straight up invented from thin air. If you'd like a map there's one on UDisc: https://udisc.com/courses/mendip-disc-golf-course-UsYl/layouts/99055/caddie-book and if you'd like a course preview, here's a man playing with himself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjiLXbj0sbg (although a couple of holes have changed since then.)

When we complete the course, we'll have a prize putting contest to round the day off and then all head home with the option to meet up for dinner and drinks later.

That's about it! Hope you've been practicing!
