Hello Saturday Friends!

Next _Saturday_; We meet at _Mendip Activity Centre_ car park at _12 midday_. https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.3321351,-2.8153744,16.46z?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkyMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D

If you've not been before you'll want some decent footwear, some discs to throw and some weather-appropriate clothing. There is a cafe and toilets at the car park if you like that sort of thing, but probably bring some water as well.

There are THREE official signed layouts at the centre and we will be playing none of them; instead we will play the "Johnnie Walker" layout from uDisc which comprises all ten of the advanced holes, a couple of the intermediate holes and a couple of holes just straight up invented from thin air. If you'd like a map there's one on UDisc: https://udisc.com/courses/mendip-disc-golf-course-UsYl/layouts/99055/caddie-book and if you'd like a course preview, here's a man playing with himself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjiLXbj0sbg (although a couple of holes have changed since then.)

When we complete the course, we'll have a prize putting contest to round the day off and then all head home with the option to meet up for dinner and drinks later.

That's about it! Hope you've been practicing!

Hello Sunday Friends!

On the _Sunday_ we will meet at _Ashton Court_ at _2pm_, as some people are busy in the morning. I would park in the _Mansion Car Park_ to be near enough to the course, but with toilets and a cafe to hand. If we meet in the Cafe courtyard we can all walk down to the course together. https://maps.app.goo.gl/c13iWd7FGDeyr4Rm9

As with the Saturday, good footwear is a must, as well as tough trousers to withstand the brambles we'll all be digging through for discs! Because of the Saturday tournament the course should be in great shape (so maybe a bit less digging in the rough!) and we are spoiled with a proper Caddie book! We'll play the 2025 Tournament Red layout as detailed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10WP6KIZILrWB6oVkAT0PJ1Zoe4gj4RCr/view

There is almost a fly-over of the course as well; with the only two differences being the first hole is now the last hole and the old hole 17 has been replaced with a fun elevated basket in a slightly different location https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R078qdH-PGE

This is my "home" course where I first learned the sport, so really looking forward to all you bastards beating my best scores.
