Welcome to the **Rhodes & Rhodes South West Invitational** – the least prestigious private disc golf tournament in South West England!

This exclusive, invitation-only event brings together ~~the finest~~ some disc golf players from across the region for an unforgettable tour of competition, camaraderie, and ~~championship-level~~ play.

## What To Expect

We'll kick off with an opening weekend extravaganza of TWO excellent courses; Ashton Court and Mendip DGC.

We'll tee off at Ashton Court on the Saturday, followed by a best-putter contest, and then the second round at the Mendips, just South of Bristol on the Sunday before heading home.

Players are invited to stay in Bristol overnight on the Saturday and make a weekend of it, with dinner and drinks on the Saturday night.

Two single-day events will then take place, one at Beaminster, Dorset and one at Mount Edgecoombe, near Plymouth. The Dorset course amy be a single-day there-and-back again, but the Plymouth course we can make an evening out in The Ocean City.

We will then wrap up the tournament with another double-bill weekend, arriving at Basset Down on the Saturday for a round, before staying overnight at the Cricklade Hotel & Spa in Swindon, in order to play the final round on the Sunday in their excellent private course. Why not bring a partner for a nice spa trip between rounds?

Before we all head home there will be a very special, unique prize for the winner!

## Costs and Player Commitment

As this is a FREE tournament, all players are to cover there own costs of travel, accommodation and green-fees. See the Fixtures page for details. We expect ~£150 for the Hotel on the final weekend, and course fees as we go, along with travel costs.

If you can't make every single course, we have a no-show rule whereby you will be scored as equal to the worst score on the day. Although obviously we'd love to see you at every course!
