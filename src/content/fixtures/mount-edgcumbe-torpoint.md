Experience disc golf at one of the most spectacular locations in the tournament series. Mount Edgcumbe offers breathtaking views across Plymouth Sound and challenging play through historic parkland. Players will navigate through woodland and open parkland with stunning coastal views and deer and sheep grazing.

This is always a very long and challenging course, and usually a fairly windy one, so expect some frustration!

We'll be capping off the round with a Longest Drive prize round, so get practicing on that arm speed!

## Course Information

There are no fixed fees, but donations to the club are welcome.

## Getting There

Mount Edgcumbe is accessible via the Torpoint Ferry from Plymouth or by road through Cornwall. The ferry crossing adds to the adventure and provides beautiful views of the naval city.

## Historic Setting

The Mount Edgcumbe estate has over 800 years of history, and players will be throwing their discs through grounds that have been enjoyed by visitors for centuries. The combination of natural beauty and historical significance makes this a truly memorable venue.

## Weather Considerations

Being close to the coast, weather conditions can change quickly. Be prepared for wind and potential rain, especially in December.

## What to Bring

- Tournament-legal discs
- Plenty of water
- Weather-appropriate clothing
- Positive attitude!
