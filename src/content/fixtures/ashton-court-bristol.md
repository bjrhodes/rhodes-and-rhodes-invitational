Join us for the second round of the Rhodes and Rhodes Invitational at the beautiful Ashton Court in Bristol. This historic venue offers stunning views over the city and provides an excellent challenge for disc golf enthusiasts of all levels. Ashton Court is one of the premier disc golf courses in the South West, featuring a mix of open and wooded holes that will test your accuracy and distance control. The course takes advantage of the natural topography of the estate, with elevation changes and mature trees creating strategic shot requirements.

It's a long and challenging course featuring many holes over 100m and two holes over 200m including a MASSIVE 290m par 5.

We'll also be hosting a prize putting contest on the day, so after a course of long-drives, you'll have a chance to show off your short-game!

## Course Information

Green Fees are payable to Yeti Disc Golf Club (£3.20) and you can pay online by following the link through the uDisc app.

Ashton Court is easily accessible from Bristol city centre and has ample parking available. The course is well-signposted from the main entrance to the estate.
